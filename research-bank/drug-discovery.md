## Definition

-   Drug discovery is a complex and time-consuming process that involves identifying new drug candidates, testing their efficacy and toxicity, and optimizing their properties.

## Why AI?

-   Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize drug discovery by accelerating the process and reducing the cost.

-   Using Machine Learning Algorithms, Researchers can identify new drug candidates and predict their efficacy and toxicity with high accuracy.
